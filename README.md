# A Multifaceted Product Recommendation System
Link: https://teamboxcoxrox.github.io/teamboxcoxrox.gitlab.io/
## DESCRIPTION

The final deliverable of this project is an interactive web-based application that allows users to search for pet
products that have been organized and prioritized based on extensive analytical techniques applied to customer product
reviews.  This approach differs from Amazon search interface, which is largely driven by seller. For more information
about this project, please refer to the complete project report and supporting documents in the DOCS folder.

This repository contains the visualization components for the team project for Team #017 Boxcoxrox for 
Georgia Tech CSE 6242 for Spring 2021.  The code in this repository provides a visualization for the 
output of the data processing pipeline found in the boxcoxrox repo.
